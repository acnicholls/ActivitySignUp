# activity-sign-up
Activity Sign Up web application


# Purpose
This application was created as an part of an interview process

# Overview
It is unfinished.  While I have strong C# and SQL skills, my javascript skills are not so great.  My TypeScript skills until this project were non-existent.  I will continue to work on this in my spare time and complete it.

# ActivitySignUpDocumentation
you will find the project desciription in this folder, along will the documentation that I created to outline my process, my thoughts on the UI and the database.  The documentation is less than I would try to give for a project with a longer timeline, but due to the time constraint, it was mostly hand-written.  I normally would transcribe the UML to Visio documents, and for the UI I normally would expect the client to provide "what they want" but since I have recently learned about Figma, I will soon begin to use that.

# the application
this application is an Angular 10 user interface with a dotnetcore3.1 C# REST Web Api, built using the Onion architecture pattern that I also recently learned.  This is my first project to start from scratch using this pattern and these two languages together.  

# my vision
my vision was to produce a website that displayed a list of available activities when the user first visits.  The user would click on an activity and be taken to a page that would display more in-depth details about the activity as well as a sign-up form.  If the user submits the sign up form, the page then switches the view of the activity to a list of participants on the left, with a list of comments on the right.  I am hoping to make the comments list real-time to allow the users to discuss the activity in real-time.
